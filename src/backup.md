# Backup

In the backup screen, you can back up all locally-created data into a file.

## Create Backup

By clicking the "Backup" button, all 

- Transactions, 
- Scheduled Transactions, and
- Settings

will be output into a backup file marked with the current date and time.

## Restore Backup

To restore a previously-created backup, use "Select a File" button to locate the backup file. Then confirm that this is the file you want restored. Note that this will replace any existing records already on the device.
