# Transaction Editor

This is the screen for editing a Transaction record. It is used when creating a new Transaction or when editing an existing one.

## Postings

The Postings section lists the Postings attached to the Transaction.

The buttons on top allow for operations on Postings:
- Adding a new Posting
- reordering Postings
- deleting Postings

The sum of all Postings is also shown, for quick balance check.

When selecting the Amount field, the contents of the field will be automatically selected, allowing easier replacement of the whole value by simply typing in a new number.
