# Transaction Editor

This is the screen for editing a Transaction record. It is used when creating a new Transaction or when editing an existing one.

On the top there are three fields:
- Date
- Payee
- Note

## Postings

The Postings section lists the Postings attached to the Transaction.

It shows the Posting fields:
- Account
- Amount
- Currency

The amount sign (+/-) is shown as a button and can be changed with a click.

The buttons on the top of the section allow for conducting the following operations on Postings:
- adding a new Posting
- reordering Postings
- deleting Postings

The sum of all Postings is also shown, for quick balance check.

When selecting the Amount field, the contents of the field will be automatically selected, allowing easier replacement of the whole value by simply typing in a new number.
